Wix TODOs

This is stuff that needs to be done to wix to make it more useable.

* Wix currently always marks pages as watched.  Consider storing the entire
  html file as ref so that we can do this according to the Mediawiki user 
  preference.

* Make more use of the output levels in general (or scrap them)

* Consider switching to Wikimedia's conflict resolution facility

* Add a do_status command for checking login status

* Add a mechanism for checking if wix is run in the right directory level

* Switch to Exception::Class from regular die exceptions (Carp appears to
  be broken for some uses).

* Perhaps separate the language code from the Base URL

* Add a commit comment editor

* Add user override for commiting text in which there might be conflicts
