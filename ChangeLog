    Summary:
      created exception for spam filter response
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-25

    If the page you are trying to commit contains a URL which trips the spam
    filter the page cannot be commited.  The client now recogizes this
    situation and throws an appropriate exception.

    Summary:
      fixed major merge bug
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-20

    There have been merge problems all along with Algorithm::Diff::Apply, in
    that it sometimes would loose the local changes, in trying to abstract away
    conflicts.  I had tried Algorithm::Merge, but that was even worse, since it
    completely destroyed files.  So now we are on VCS::Lite, which seems to
    work better.

2005-05-03 08:27:26 GMT	Mark Jaroski <mark@geekhive.net>	patch-15

    Summary:
      server conflict check works again
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-15

    The do_commit method now correctly throws an exception if the version on
    the server has changed.  I went back to taking down the server version and
    comparing it.  I was hoping to have the server make the decision by sending
    it the wpEditTime field, that however seems to be a struggle, and is in
    some ways *more* error prone than doing the comparison.
    
    That said there is still the tiny chance of somebody making a change during
    the few cycles between our comparison and our upload.  That's a race
    condition, so if sending the date can be made reliable then that's the way
    to do it.

    Summary:
      do_update tested
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-13

    The basic server tests for do_update (and do_commit) are working now.  I
    still have to do some more exception testing, and try to find and test any
    boundary conditions.

    Revision:

    Summary:
      More work on newly exposed methods
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-3

    Added more documentation for the newly exposed methods.  Also encorporated
    the upload method into do_commit, and changed the way that conflicts are
    detected.  Previously the local version, server version, and reference
    version of a page was compared.  Now the mtime stamp of the reference file
    gets sent up to the server as the edit time so that the server can tell us
    if there is a conflict.

2005-04-24 15:08:24 GMT	Mark Jaroski <mark@geekhive.net>	patch-1

    Summary:
      added real exceptions, started overhaul of API
    Revision:
      WWW-Mediawiki-Client--0.25--patch-1

    The tree is decidedly broken at this point, but I'm commiting anyhow as a
    checkpoint.  So far I've done this:
    
    * Added real exceptions and verified that they didn't break anything
    * Broke everything by starting some reforms in the way URLs get built
    * Exposed a number of private methods which could be of use to others
    
    TODO before this is stable and releasable:
    
    * Write docs for the newly exposed methods
    * Finish the URL reforms and test them
    * Delete tests which are no longer applicable
    * Write tests against a real server
    * Write tests for WWW::Mediawiki::Client::Exceptions
    * Fix bin/mvs to work with the changes and exceptions
