2004-03-30 08:39:34 GMT	Mark Jaroski <mark@geekhive.net>	patch-13

    Summary:
      Added the rest of the modules for CPAN test
    Revision:
      wix--mainline--0.1--patch-13

    Apparently there are a couple more non-standard modules used here, so I
    just went ahead and made everything I've used a prereq.  I realise that
    this is probably overkill because some of these are in the standard
    distribution.  Oh well.

    Summary:
      Added dependancy on Test::Differences to avoid CPAN test failure
    Revision:
      wix--mainline--0.1--patch-12

    This is a stop-gap to allow these tests to pass on the CPAN auto-test
    platforms.  At some point I plan to fix the test scripts to either use
    Test::Differences or not depending on its availablility.

2004-03-25 19:13:00 GMT	Mark Jaroski <mark@geekhive.net>	patch-11

    Summary:
      Added default initialisation values for Wikpedia and Wikitravel
    Revision:
      wix--mainline--0.1--patch-11

    Wikipedia and Wikitravel are the two of the most commonly used Mediawiki
    sites, so it makes sense that useing these sites with wix should be as easy
    as possible.  This change causes the wix script to initialise using
    reasonable default values for URLs which correspond to one of those sites.

    Summary:
      Added additional debugging stuff for Wikipedia
    Revision:
      wix--mainline--0.1--patch-8

    I got a complaint the other day that WWW::Mediawiki::Client and hence wix
    doesn't actually work with Wikipedia.  Carp!  So I'm working on a solution,
    and improving the module's debugging capability as I go.

2004-03-18 15:05:28 GMT	Mark Jaroski <mark@geekhive.net>	patch-6

    Summary:
      Fixed HTTP failure bug.  Eliminated multi-file updating and commiting.
    Revision:
      wix--mainline--0.1--patch-6

    I noticed a bug in which local files were getting blanked when the HTTP
    request failed.  This could be very bad, since if the user fails to double
    check the contents they might overwrite the page on the server.
    
    Also I took out the multi-file updates and commits.  The convenience is not
    worth the risk or the load on the server.
